# Single Event Mod (PS2)

PS2 port of the Single Event Mod.  

## Usage

- Identify your game region
- Use the provided **xdelta** file to patch your game iso (there are various patching tools available, such as [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/latest))
- Enable the **Mastercode** and the **Single Event Mod code**
- Profit

If you're already using a different Mastercode I recommend using the one listed here instead, replacing it won't break your other cheats.
