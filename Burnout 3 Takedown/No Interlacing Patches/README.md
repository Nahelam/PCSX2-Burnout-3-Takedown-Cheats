# No Interlacing Patches

The PAL versions of the game (SLES-52584 & SLES-52585) doesn't have a way to turn on 480p mode.\
These patches allows them to run in 480p (progressive scan) mode by choosing the 60 Hz refresh rate.

The NTSC patch (SLUS-21050) will make the game always ask if you want the 480p mode during game booting.
