# Crazy AI Physics

While looking into collision stuff I tried to make the game think that all race cars wheels were always on groud. It completely messed-up physics in a funny way thus I decided to make a patch out of it.

I excluded player cars from this physics madness because it was unplayable (although I had a nice [sparkles trip](https://i.imgur.com/rjRHgY9.mp4)).

I also reduced the gravity of the AI cars while they are driving to make them act crazy more often.

## Variants

I split this patch into 3 variants, use **only one at once!**

### Variant 1: Basic

The most basic one, messing-up AI physics and let them crash by default.

### Variant 2: Local Wildlife

Same as the first variant except that I prevented the messed-up physics to crash AI cars. Sometimes it can lead to some [nice shows](https://i.imgur.com/Dw2la7S.mp4).

### Variant 3: Mayhem

[Explosive version](https://i.imgur.com/McWryVf.mp4) of the first variant, even more spicy when combined with the [Crash Breaker Expansion patch](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Crash%20Breaker%20Expansion).

## Notes

- If you want to be able to see other vehicles explosion effects **while driving**, you can use the "extra particles" patch available [here](<https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various>).
