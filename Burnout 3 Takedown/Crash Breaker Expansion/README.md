# Crash Breaker Expansion

These patches expands the Crash Breaker to all game modes.
I already made a [patch expanding it](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/blob/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various/SLUS-21050/BEBF8793_crashbreaker_in_all_modes.pnach) but it is a pretty bare-bones version, only traffic vehicles are affected.
I took the expansion to the next level by making AI and other players affected by the explosion.
To reward the player, crashbreakered race cars are registered as aftertouch takedowns, the HUD prompt shows while crashing and split screen mode is supported.
If you want to be able to see other vehicles explosion effects **while driving**, you can use the "render explosions" patch available [here](<https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various>)
