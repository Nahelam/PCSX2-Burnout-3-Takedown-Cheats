# Crash Breaker Expansion

These patches expands the Crash Breaker to all game modes.

I already made a [patch expanding it](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/blob/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various/SLUS-21050/BEBF8793_crashbreaker_in_all_modes.pnach) but it is pretty bare-bones, only traffic vehicles are affected.

## Features

I took the expansion to the next level by adding the following features: 
- AI and other players are now affected by the explosion
- Crash Breakered race cars are registered as Aftertouch Takedowns
- Crash Breaker HUD prompt while crashing (including split screen mode)

## Notes

- If you want to be able to see other vehicles explosion effects **while driving**, you can use the "extra particles" patch available [here](<https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various>).
- If you were using my previous Crash Breaker patch, make sure to remove it before using this one.
