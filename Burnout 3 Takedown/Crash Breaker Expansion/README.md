# Crash Breaker Expansion

These patches expands the Crash Breaker to all game modes.

I already made a [patch expanding it](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/blob/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various/SLUS-21050/BEBF8793_crashbreaker_in_all_modes.pnach) but it is a pretty bare-bones version, only traffic vehicles are affected.

I took the expansion to the next level by adding the following features: 
- AI and other players are now affected by the explosion
- Crashbreakered race cars are registered as aftertouch takedowns
- HUD prompt while crashing (including split screen mode)

If you want to be able to see other vehicles explosion effects **while driving**, you can use the "render explosions" patch available [here](<https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Various>).

PS2 raw codes can be found in the [PS2](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/Crash%20Breaker%20Expansion/PS2) folder.

If you were using my previous Crash Breaker patch, make sure to remove it before using this one.
