# Crash Breaker Expansion (PS2)

## Embedding

Since this patch is too big for PS2 cheat engines, it has to be embedded in the game executable to work properly.

Thanks to the [ELF Code Cave](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/ELF%20Code%20Cave) we have more than enough space to make it happen.

These diff patches have been generated using xdelta3, you can apply them to your game iso using a patching tool such as [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/latest).

As the patch isn't fully embedded (to remain toggleable) you will have to run your patched game iso using the code provided in the txt file to enable the Crash Breaker Expansion.

## Notes

Online support is included in the provided xdelta patches.
