# Crash Breaker Expansion (PS2)

## Embedding

Since this patch is too big for PS2 cheat engines, it has to be embedded in the game executable to work properly.

Thanks to the [ELF Code Cave](https://github.com/Nahelam/PS2-Game-Mods/tree/main/Burnout%203%20Takedown/ELF%20Code%20Cave) we have more than enough space to make it happen.

Please note that it hasn't been embedded fully (to remain toggleable).\

After patching your game iso (using [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/latest) for example), you have to use the code provided in the txt file to enable the Crash Breaker Expansion.

## Notes

Online support is included in the provided xdelta patches.
