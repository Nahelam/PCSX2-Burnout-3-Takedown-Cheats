# PCSX2 Burnout 3: Takedown Widescreen Patches 

The `Aero_` folder contains the widescreen patches made by [Aero_](https://github.com/AeroWidescreen) that I ported to `SLES-52585`.

The other folders contains a patch to force the game to run in widescreen mode (equivalent to enabling widescreen in your PS2 BIOS).
