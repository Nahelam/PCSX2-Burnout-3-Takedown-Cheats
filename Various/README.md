# PCSX2 Burnout 3: Takedown Mods

This folder contains various cheats/patches/mods I made for Burnout 3: Takedown.

Features:
- Speedometer HUD unit patches (mph->kph on SLES, kph->mph on SLUS)
- Allow heavyweights class to be chosen in all online game modes (all players must enable it)
- Allow online games to be started even you're the only player in the lobby
- AI road rage behavior in normal races
- Turn all cars (except traffic) into tuk-tuks
- Enable non-takedown burnout points in road rage mode
