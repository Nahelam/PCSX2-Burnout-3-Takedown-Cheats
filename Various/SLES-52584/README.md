# PCSX2 Burnout 3: Takedown Mods (SLES-52584)

This folder contains various cheats/patches/mods I made for Burnout 3: Takedown.

## Features
- Speedometer HUD unit patches (kph->mph)
- Heavyweights class always available in garage
- Allow heavyweights class to be chosen in all online game modes (all players must enable it)
- Allow online games to be started even you're the only player in the lobby
- AI road rage behavior in normal races
- Turn all cars (except traffic) into tuk-tuks
- Enable non-takedown burnout points in road rage mode
- Force standing start in offline modes
- Change deformation impulse scale (set the float value of your choice on line 6)

## Notes
- "Heavyweights always available" is **required** to get heavyweights online working
